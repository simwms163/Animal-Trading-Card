            <p class = "stop">There are more than 1,300 species of bats in the world, making them the second most common group of mammals after rodents. Bats are unique. Even though they share the characteristics of all mammals - hair, regulated body temperature, the ability to bear their young alive and nurse them - bats are the only mammals to truly fly. </p>
             <ul id="line">
                <li><span class="topic">Scientific name</span>: Chiroptera</li>
                <li><span class="topic">Average Lifespan</span>: It’s said that the smaller the animal, the shorter its lifespan, but bats break that rule of longevity. Although most bats live less than 20 years in the wild, scientists have documented six species that life more than 30 years. In 2006, a tiny bat from Siberia set the world record at 41 years.</li>
                <li><span class="topic">Habitat</span>: Bats can be found on nearly every part of the planet except in extreme deserts and polar regions</li>
                <li><span class="topic">Average Length</span>: Bats range in size from the Kitti’s hog-nosed bat (also called the Bumblebee Bat) that weighs less than a penny — making it the world’s smallest mammal — to the flying foxes, which can have a wingspan of up to 6 feet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p id="low">Without bats, there wouldn't be any bananas, avocados and mangoes. Over 300 species of fruits depend on bats for pollination, which they do at night. Bats help spread seeds for nuts, figs and cacao — the main ingredient in chocolate. Without bats, we also wouldn’t have plants like agave or the iconic saguaro cactus. </p>
